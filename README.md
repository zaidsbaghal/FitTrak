## Intro

This was a very fun project to make and I learned a lot about Android devleopment in the process. The purpose of this project was to expose myself to app development as well as exposure to programming within a team of other engineers (IOS and Backend). 

The main goal for this project was to make a fitness tracker app that could take in custom created exercises from the user and save them on different logs corresponding to different days. A more comprehensive list of features is provided below. Overall, I learned a lot form this project and although it is rather bare bones at the moment, I look forward to adding more features and improving usability in the future. This page will be updated when progress is made.
